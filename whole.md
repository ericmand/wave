Designing a Demand Driven Program
The WAVE Way
1. Define Target Population
The first step in designing any program is to appropriately define your target population in
order to ensure that all subsequent decisions are made with the group in mind. Target
population refers to the group or type of people with shared characteristics an organization
plans to serve. Often, the target population is defined in your organization’s mission and
vision.
Identifying Target Audience
2. Labour Market Research
The next step in creating a demand-driven program is conducting research on the labour
market in your community. The essence of a demand-driven program is to ensure that your
program is meeting the human resource needs of EPs within your target community, and
training youth to align their skill sets with those needs. Demand-driven programs should not
be created without the engagement of EPs. Your targeted geography, organization’s
resources and its human capacity will drive the scope of your labour market research. In
addition, your research should be driven by key questions you seek to answer. During
WAVE’s inception stage, the primary question was “What are the high-growth industries in
Nigeria that could absorb thousands of less educated (uncredentialed) youth?What are the
top employers in those industries?”
Depending on your community, secondary data is often available by way of labour market
reports, which can provide you with an overview of the high growth industries within your
community. With this information, the next step is to drill down further to research top
companies that are hiring and ask targeted questions. However, if your organization is
located in a relatively small region or market, with limited market data, your organization will
have to conduct primary research to understand the labour market.

How to Conduct Labour Market Research (small region/community)
o Design labour market research survey questions
o Build a database of industries/sectors within your community (retail, hospitality,
consumer goods, social sector, light manufacturing, construction, etc)
o Research different organizations within your community. Note: leverage online
job portals, newspaper adverts, government reports.
o Identify and select potential target organizations. The number depends on
available resources
o Establish contact with organizations, seek for interview with HR manager
and/or CEO
o Discuss/Interview key contact focusing on answering research questions
o Compile and analyze responses
o Verify conclusions with employers

3. Building Employer Organization Partnerships
After concluding your research and identifying key sectors, the next step is to focus on
building relationships with the EPs you met at the research stage. Building lasting,
long-term relationships will enable your organization to meet its objectives faster and will be
beneficial to all stakeholders.
Steps in building partnerships
o Establish your partnership goals. It is important to know what you want to
achieve from a partner, while being flexible and creative. Your partnership
goals may vary with the different employers you select to approach. Example
goals: I want to secure this employer as a contributor to curriculum
development. I want to secure this partner to be an off-taker (employer) of
youth my organization trains.
o Identify/outline your organization’s value proposition. Develop a
presentation about your organization and what it can offer to different partners.
The presentation should include relevant information about your organization,
such as its mission, vision, services and value proposition. Ensure the value
proposition is aligned with the established goals.
o Make contact with selected organization. For maximum impact and
efficiency, select businesses that you engaged during the Labour Market
Research as you already have a relationship with them.
o Introduce your organization, its services and value proposition.
o Follow up with partner on agreed next steps. Following up ensures that you
are continuously engaged with your partners and keeping your end of the
bargain.

Designing a Demand-Driven Program
4. Design your training curriculum
Designing a curriculum for your program has several components, ranging from training
goals to training evaluation. It is a comprehensive, detailed and thorough exercise. Often,
organizations utilize third party service providers as consultants to design and create their
curriculum. When designing a curriculum, it is important to invoke all four principles to
ensure you have a curriculum that is activity based, focused on the outcomes of the learner,
and receives the expert input and stamp of approval from EPs.
ADDIE is a common instructional systems design (ISD) model used by instructional
designers and training developers. The five phases—Analysis, Design, Development,
Implementation, and Evaluation—are guidelines for building effective training and
performance support tools. Replicators can use the ADDIE model to build their curriculums.
27
Needs Assessment. For a demand-driven program, the needs assessment must take into
consideration the perspective of the two main stakeholders - the EP and the candidates (or
employees). The information gathered from the Labour Market Research can double as the
needs assessment for the employers. The report should provide an overview of the skills
and competencies that employers/market require. The employers may provide a list of skills
and competencies and it is necessary for the organization to decide which skills it has the
resources and capacity (financial and human) to train young people in. It is also necessary
to conduct a needs assessment of the target audience, i.e. the youth. The assessment
should focus on the gap between the skills and knowledge the trainees have and what
employers require. The outcome of the need assessments should be a list of skills and
competencies the training plans to address.
Design. The design phase of the process provides a framework for your training. This
phase focuses on the structure of your training program, the knowledge, skills and
competencies that participants need to acquire from the training program. It also includes
the instructional objectives, outcomes, delivery methods, time allocation and assessment
tools. In summary it gives you an outline of what your program would look like. Replicators
should involve both EPs and a sample set from the identified target audience in the design
phase to ensure alignment in identified skills and competencies.
Development. The development phase focuses on building the assets - content,
presentations, lesson exercises, assessment rubrics, and materials required for the training.
This stage is the core of your program and requires you to engage with partners in the
revision stages to ensure the overall curriculum is aligned with their requirements and
transferring the outlined skills in an effective manner.
It is highly recommended that you have a conversation with partners to ensure the content is
aligned with their needs. Hold a few revision sessions to finalize the content before general
implementation.
Designing a Demand-Driven Program
28
Designing a Demand Driven Program
Implementation. Implementation of the training is where all elements of the analyses,
design and development phases come together. Implementation is important because it is
when the instructor and the content come in contact with the target audience with the aim of
producing the learning outcomes. This phase focuses on the delivery and teaching of the
content and requires facilitators that are prepared and have the ability to engage a diverse
range of trainees
Evaluation. Evaluation is a key aspect of the process and should be embedded at every
stage of the training, not just at the end. Once the curriculum has been created, the first
evaluation should be conducted to ensure the content and activities will enable participants
to obtain the specified outcomes. Assessments should be created for the training delivery
component of the program to ensure daily understanding of topics as well as how these
topics fit into the overall program objectives. Evaluations should be structured to ensure that
they always align with the outcome. WAVE utilizes “exit ticket questions” to test daily
understanding of concepts. It also uses baseline, midline and end-line assessments.

5. Training-Employment Connection
A demand-driven program aims to place every youth trained into paying jobs. However, the
reality is that there may not be enough paying vacancies to meet these goals. As an
organization, it is important to create useful training-job linkages as alumni wait for a
placement. At WAVE, the following connections are utilized to provide useful job
experience that enable a trainee to build upon their skills set, the competencies learned
from the training, as well as increase their general job experience.
Job Shadow. Job shadow is an in-office experience that enables alumni to explore a
specific career of interest by observing a professional in that field perform their work duties
at their place of employment. The experience provides some realistic career information
that will aid the trainee in making career choices. In addition, it helps the individual develop
their confidence, awareness, and prepare to take on a role similar to the one that they have
shadowed. Job shadows are typically unpaid though most employers are willing to provide
a daily transportation stipend to subsidize the participation costs borne by trainees.
Many organizations use job shadowing as an effective tool for training new entrants/hires
and building up the capacity of existing employees by having them codify and teach their
processes to others. It is also increasingly used as a tool to vet the competencies and "fit"
of prospective hires. As a replicator, job shadowing becomes a way to complement
classroom learning as aspiring employees get to experience firsthand how to apply skills
learned in the classroom on the job. They also get to assess their own job role preferences
based on their firsthand experience of the shadowed role. It also serves as a recruitment
pathway with top-performing trainees getting offered fulltime roles in many cases.
At WAVE each trainee is linked to a job shadow assignment in the key industries WAVE
trains for, i.e. retail and hospitality. This assignment usually occurs in the third and final
week of training.
Designing a Demand-Driven Program
30
How to create job shadow program/opportunities for candidates
1. Establish your goals for the job shadow program.
2. Ensure there is at least one week of job shadow opportunities within program design. Job
shadow opportunity should be in the industries you train for. Labour market research will
reveal the relevant industry.
3. During Labour market research, confirm if organizations will be interested in your
organization’s job shadow program.
4. During follow up meetings, make the case for the benefits of job shadowing for both EPs
and candidates in order to register organizations for the program. Note: This is an
ongoing process as your organization builds relationships with new EPs.
5. Compose and send letters to organizations that express interest in your job shadow
program in order to secure their commitment.
6. Create process of matching candidates to job shadow opportunities. Note: matching
process should be based on a candidate’s interest, their competencies, and
competencies required for the job.
7. Create a job shadow manual to brief candidates on expectations, and to reflect on and
track progress.
8. Create a job shadow assessment tool which will be used to obtain both candidate and
EP’s feedback
9. Provide opportunity for candidates to reflect publically on job placement i.e. formal
presentation to class, poster presentation.
Designing a Demand-Driven Program
31
Internships. An internship is often an unpaid job that provides alumni with some work
experience. It is typically broader than a job shadow opportunity because the alumni is
usually given some responsibilities and gets more involved in the activities of the
organization.
Part-time work. Alumni can be employed within your organization on a part-time basis,
similar to an internship, to help support operations. Within this capacity, the trainee can
perform meaningful tasks that help reinforce the concepts at the training in addition to
providing immediate feedback.
Self-employment. Self-employment is working for one’s self. While alumni wait to be
placed, the program should encourage self-employment as an option. This is possible by
helping alumni identify and define their skill sets and how they can be translated to a
service, which can be rendered for pay.
Self-placement. While the organization aims to place alumni in paying jobs, the alumni
should be his or her own primary job placement advocate. As a result, the program should
have sessions focused on teaching alumni how to secure jobs for themselves. This often
requires digital literacy skills, ability to create a reliable online profile, ability to cold call and
seek for job vacancies in and around the community.

Audience
This section of the toolkit is targeted towards replicators that are in the beginning stages of
their operations, i.e. building their brand recognition and reputation. The main characteristic
of such a replicating organization is that it typically does not have a steady stream of young
people to train and match to jobs; thus, the priority is to actively seek out young people to
utilize its services. This section is also valuable for replicators that are interested in learning
how to effectively recruit young people into youth-focused programs in a cost-effective,
efficient and data-driven manner.
Finding Applicants
Definition
Finding candidates is the act of identifying new people to join the training program. This is
usually done through an outreach initiative.
Outreach is as an act of proactively reaching out to a targeted population who need a set of
services rather than waiting for the identified population to come and ask for help. Outreach
marketing focuses “on human to human connection” while encouraging the establishment of
“connection with your consumers instead of marketing at them” For new and relatively
young organizations, outreach can help with building brand awareness.
Outcomes
This section of the toolkit will provide you with the tools and resources that will enable you
to:
o Apply the principles of how WAVE finds candidates for its program through their
outreach efforts.
o Understand how to replicate two of WAVE’s most effective outreach approaches.
38
Finding Applicants
Why It’s Important
The first step in the WAVE process is outreach, which focuses on finding self-motivated,
underserved youth who are willing to learn and determined to succeed. The dedicated
Outreach and Admissions team carries out the process. This team is mandated to recruit
candidates for screening in order to enroll them in the training program.
At WAVE, a strong recruitment and outreach initiative enables the organization to raise
awareness about its program while proactively targeting the desired population. Over the
years, WAVE has learned that for for every 100 people that apply to the training program,
an average of 25-30 will graduate the program. As a result, it is advised that the outreach
team target 4 times as many people as they would like to graduate!
39
Finding Applicants
Principle in Action!
Below are tips in creating a marketing message
o Know your audience
o Get to the point
o Take the target audience’s view point
o Focus on a few themes – keep messaging simple
o Differentiate your service from others
o Articulate your audience’s problem and solve it
o Have a call for action (next steps)
`
Principles
Your message is vital for recruitment.
The message to your target audience is one of the most important steps as it represents
your organization’s opportunity to articulate the problem proposition (what is the problem
your customer is experiencing and how big is it), the value proposition (what is the solution
you are offering and the value of this solution) and why your target audience should pay
attention. It is important to understand your unique value proposition and sell it with a
message that is easy to understand. Your message should be short and impactful, leaving
potential candidates with the desire to attend the the next step of the admissions process,
an information session. Given the importance of messaging, all carriers of the message
should be adequately trained to deliver it accurately and consistently.
As best practice, WAVE keeps its messages clear, concise and brief in order to entice
potential participants to want to learn more. By strategically keeping the message short and
limiting the information about the program provided during the first interaction with a
potential participant, WAVE makes it more likely that participants will show up to an
information session. At this point, the participants get to learn more about the program and
interact with senior team members.
40
Finding Applicants
Principles
Target youth through various outreach channels in order to drive
awareness.
Every organization must invest in some form of marketing and outreach effort in order to
build its brand recognition and awareness. In the early stage, it is recommended that all
outreach approaches be explored in order to gather data on the most cost effective and
efficient channel. To attain the best results, outreach efforts should focus on areas where
youth gather en masse and build connections with people that have positive influences on
their lives.
For example, at WAVE, the program was marketed through several channels including
word of mouth, alumni referrals, town-storming, social media, partnerships at the state and
local government levels, radio, conferences, religious institutions, etc. Over the years,
through the use of collected data, WAVE has refined its main outreach channels.
41
Finding Applicants
. Principle in Action!
1. Invite 3-5 youth to your organization’s brainstorming session.
2. Hold brainstorming session with team members and youth. The objective is to identify locations
where youth gather and the best method to reach them.
3. List what locations (predictable and unpredictable) locations youth gather en masse either
formally or informally.
4. Map out the best ways to reach the youth at the different identified locations.
5. Implement outreach strategy.
6. Keep track of which method brings in quality candidates and the associated acquisition costs.

Finding Applicants
Principle in Action!
Follow the below steps and set up an alumni referral program:
1. As an organization, determine how much you can afford to give alumni that successfully refer
candidates to the organization. Gift can either be monetary or items such as phone airtime.
2. Create incentive for alumni that refers the most candidates i.e. face of the alumnus on
organizational promotional materials, speaking opportunities at upcoming training.
3. During graduation and other organization events, announce/remind alumni of the referral
initiative – provide the rationale for the program, and what alumni stand to gain.
4. Periodically remind alumni of referral program via phone call and/or email


`
Principles
Involve Alumni to yield better results.
Involving proponents of your program is a highly effective recruiting tool. Even more
effective is if the proponent is an individual that has first-hand experience with the program
and can effectively speak about the impact it has had on his on her life. An enthusiastic
alumnus is your most powerful sales person. Alumni are in the best position to speak about
the benefits of the program as they are walking testaments of your product.
WAVE has seen the benefit of this principle with the establishment of its alumni referral
program. The program rewards alumni with a modest financial stipend for every candidate
that is referred and graduates the program. Alumni have been the most effective forms of
new candidate referrals into the program, accounting for 45% of new trainee enrollment.
43
Finding Applicants
Principle in Action!
Below are tips in building genuine relationships with potential candidates
o When recruiting, focus on how to solve the problems of potential candidates.
o Engage potential candidate in a conversation about their employment journey.
o Willingly provide information about your employment journey in order to spark hope.
o Always follow up with potential candidates with a phone call or sms to remind them of the
upcoming information session.
o Get personal and familiar – always use the potential candidates name during conversations
o Make yourself available for any questions or concerns that potential candidates may have.
`
Principles
Making genuine connections will help with advancing participants
to next round.
The outreach process should aim to build genuine relationships with your target audience in
order to convince him/her to be part of the next step in your admissions process. This can
be achieved by actively listening and learning about potential candidate’s personal goals
and aligning them with your program’s services. When building relationships, the focus
should be on the quality of the relationships and not the quantity.
WAVE builds genuine connections with potential participants by making the process
personal. Recruiters provide phone numbers which potential participants can reach them on
if they have questions about the program. In addition, recruiters follow up by making
one-on-one phone calls to provide more information about the program and the next steps.
44

Finding Applicants
Principle in Action!
Tracking data is important. The following steps will guide you on how to start the process.
1. Identify which indicators (e.g. gender, retention rates etc) are important to you and your funders
(if you have any).
2. Create candidate application form (paper or electronic) that will enable you to collect the
identified data.
3. Use information session candidate attendance sheet to gather data as well
4. Transfer information to candidate management database (a database that contains information
on all candidates)
5. Analyze data
6. Use data to guide next steps and decisions
Principles
Use data to drive outreach initiative
Collecting and collating data in an organized manner provides your organization with
information, which can be used to better guide your outreach efforts. Data collection and
analysis enables organizations to remain innovative. With the availability of data, your
organization can determine which outreach method is the most cost-effective and efficient
and which attracts the largest numbers of candidates. The data will help you adjust your
outreach process ahead of the next admission cycle in order to meet or exceed goals.
WAVE collects outreach data by asking how a candidate heard of its program in the
application phase of its process. This data is consistently tracked and analyzed in order to
make an outreach decision. Over the years, through the use of collected data, WAVE has
identified two outreach channels - town storming and alumni referrals - that are extremely
effective in recruiting WAVE fit youth. Town Storming is an activity that generates
awareness of and interest in an organization by mass outreach on the street, while Alumni
Referrals use alumni to recommend people in their network to a program. Together, these
two channels account for over 75% of received applications.
45

The WAVE Way
Town Storming
The objective of town storming is to establish a connection and build a relationship with
people encountered “in the town” in order to make them want to learn more about WAVE by
attending an information session the following week. While there are targets set for the town
stormers, it is necessary to stress the importance of quality over quantity. This will ensure
that the right type of people will attend the information session.

Alumni Referral Program
The objective of alumni referral is to leverage your alumni in recruiting new candidates for
your program. An alumni referral program can yield great recruitment results for your
organization, as alumni are the best “sales reps” of your product due to their first-hand
experience.
Alumni Referral Process
o Leverage organizational events/program. It is important to take advantage of
organization wide events such as graduations to discuss the importance of alumni
referrals.
o Stay in touch. We recommend calling alumni one week after their graduation to
remind them to refer their friends and acquaintances to the program.
o Incentivize Alums. Create an incentive program to encourage alumni to recommend
their peers. The incentive program provides alumni with monetary or in-kind rewards
based on number of referrals. Example of rewards includes money transfer to
account, phone airtime credit and much more. We encourage organizations to get
creative on how to reward its alumni that provide referrals.
47
Lesson Learned/Tips
RECRUITMENT
o Many youth are not aware of their skill gaps and the impact of these gaps on their
unemployment status, so it becomes important to “show them, and tell them” the gaps.
o Building sustainable and mutually beneficial relationships with candidates requires
consistency, a good knowledge of relationship building and understanding of the cultural
context that may obtain.
o Parents, caregivers and influencers may contribute to the unemployment prevalence by
shielding young people from gaining worthwhile experience and constantly giving
handouts. Handouts are our biggest competitor. As a recruiter, ask yourself how you can
change mindsets; i.e. convince youth to think beyond an immediate short term solution
of handouts, and to focus on the long term, where they will require the skills they are
building today.

Screening & Assessment
The selection of program fit candidates through the
use of self-elimination and assessment tools.
50
Audience
The screening and assessment section of the toolkit is targeted towards replicators that
have established criteria for their candidates. These replicators are interested in candidates
that meet their eligibility requirement. The main priority is to ensure the candidates that
eventually make it through the program are those that possess the required competencies
for the program. This section is also valuable for replicators that are interested in learning
methods of screening and assessing candidates for a program.
Definition
Screening is the process of evaluating whether someone is the right candidate for a specific
job based on set eligibility criteria. In this context, screening is used to identify candidates
that are the right fit for the training program. These criteria are often created by the
organization based on its program’s objectives and requirements.
Assessment is defined as the evaluation or estimation of the nature, quality, or ability of
someone or something. In order to evaluate an ability, assessment tools in the form of a
standardized test is used to collect data for a specific skill e.g. writing, communication,
critical thinking.
Screening & Assessment
Outcomes
This section of the toolkit will provide you with the tools and resources that will enable you
to:
o Understand and apply the principles driving WAVE’s screening & assessment
o Design a screening and assessment protocol which enables your organization to
efficiently and effectively assess and admit candidates into your programs
51
Why It’s important
The second step in the WAVE process is screening and assessment. The objective of the
screening process is to eliminate candidates that do not meet the organization’s criteria and
for candidates to opt out of the program. The screening process includes an information
session, assessment, and admissions. A dedicated Outreach and Admissions team carries
out this process.
The process of screening and assessing candidates has many benefits including reducing
overall program cost as the organization avoids spending resources on people that do not
fit. It also increases participation and uptake of the program, and enables a better training
experience for all stakeholders. In addition, by assessing a candidate before training, you
are validating the skills which are required in order to succeed within the program.
Screening & Assessment
52
Screening & Assessment

Principle in Action!
Below are some sample questions found in WAVE’s online assessment test. These questions test
for different indicators and/or skills that WAVE has identified as important.
1. You find out there is a job where you will earn N35,000 a month but you have to
wake up at 4am six days a week for the job. How likely are you to take this job?
a) Very likely
b) Somewhat likely
c) Somewhat unlikely
d) Definitely not
Testing candidates’ motivation
Principles
Utilize assessment tools to screen for essential requirements
To ensure the candidates have the required foundational skills, administer assessments to
test for the skills (and skills levels) your organization has identified as foundational. The
foundational skills are skills that are essential for a job. They can be identified in partnership
with your EPs, and can include skills that candidates can be trained in and skills you do not
train for. For example, your organization likely does not train candidates to be literate in
English; however, if English literacy is a requirement, a test can be used to determine a
candidate’s proficiency. Assessment tools enable you to make the recruiting process
objective and also give the participant the confidence that their performance is the only
deciding factor.
WAVE has a 3-step screening process which helps the organization make an objective and
informed decision on who will be admitted into the program. There is a classroom
simulation, an online assessment, and an interview. The online assessment consists of 40
short questions to determine the candidate’s ability to speak, read and write in English
(official language of the training program), desperation to secure a job, motivation,
interpersonal skills, problem solving and basic mathematics skills. A candidate’s
performance on each step advances them to the next. The online assessment was created
by WAVE and screens for indicators which WAVE has identified as attributes required to
succeed on the job

Screening & Assessment
Principle in Action!
Create interview questions and interview assessment rubric before interviewing candidates. Below
are sample questions used by WAVE.
It is important to have a list of interview questions that test for criteria the organization is testing for.
WAVE tests and assesses across 6 indicators:
desperation (desire),
fit/Interest in WAVE,
motivation,
problem solving,
interpersonal skills,
ability to learn.
These indicators are identical to what is tested in the online/written assessment.
1. If you work in the front desk of a store and your manager suddenly assigns you to clean the
guest toilets for one week every month, what would you do?
Testing candidates’ desire for a job
2. What do you know/have you heard about WAVE and what we do?
Testing candidates’ Fit/interest in WAVE
3. Tell me about a time when you experienced a challenge
Testing candidates’ motivation
4. "You are a front desk associate at a hotel. It’s 9pm and a man and his family arrive at the hotel
from the airport to check in. They present their reservation confirmation showing that they have
paid for a room for 3 nights. However, when you check your system, you are unable to find their
names under guest reservations. Your manager has been away all day and you have been
unable to reach him via phone, SMS or email. The hotel is completely booked and there are no
available rooms. What do you do?”

Screening & Assessment
Principles
Give candidates an opportunity to self-select themselves into the
program.
Not all eligible candidates would be fit for the program. It is important for candidates to
assess if the program is a right fit for them based on the information provided. The
screening process should also enable the potential candidates who meet the eligibility
criteria to screen themselves into or out of the program. This requires providing all the
necessary information about the program including time commitment and financial
requirements. By self screening, recruited candidates are able to take a realistic stock of
their life priorities as well as the program requirements and make a decision. Self screening
results in a more dedicated candidate pool. In addition, it has the potential to save your
organization money if candidates self-select early instead of dropping out during the training
the organization when you have already invested time and resources into them.
As part of the admissions process, WAVE holds an information session aimed at providing
additional information about its program to the youth recruited during the outreach phase.
The aim of the information session is to provide more detailed information about the
program in order for the organization to sell recruits on the benefits and to give them an
opportunity to make an informed decision. There is a Q & A session which focuses on
answering the questions and concerns of the recruited youth. Being transparent, managing
expectations, giving accurate information and answering all questions truthfully enables a
candidate to decide if the program is the right fit for him/her. In addition, potential
candidates are asked specific questions in order to select themselves into the program.
56
Screening & Assessment
Principle in Action!
Ask the following questions during information session in order to encourage potential candidates to
self-select themselves into the program. It is important to tailor the questions based on the details of
your program. Example if your program is 4 weeks, ask if youth can commit to 4 weeks of training.
Raise your hand if your answer is yes to these questions. Ask each candidate one at a time.
Candidates that answer YES to all 4 questions are ready to begin the process.
1. Are you able to complete the X-week training?
2. Are you interested in a job that pays an average of N25,000 per month?
 (NOTE: Change naira amount based on the average wage in the selected industry)
3. Are you interested in an entry job in retail and hospitality (kitchen assistant, waiter,
housekeeper, sales associate? (NOTE: Change jobs based on the industries you are training
for)
4. Are you willing to work in one job for up to a year?

57
Screening & Assessment
The WAVE Way
Wave Screening/Admissions Process:
o Hold an Information Session. Executing an information session
o During session ask candidates self selection questions
If the answer is a “Yes” to each of the questions, then the candidates are willing to
continue with the process. A candidate that is not willing to put in 100% will not benefit
from your services.
o Invite candidates that meet criteria to fill a candidate application form
o Administer assessment exams (written or online).
o Grade Assessments (50% and above pass mark)
o Send SMS to candidates that passed the assessment for an in-person interview
o Hold interviews for candidates. (70% pass mark). Use an interview assessment rubric to
standardize and score candidates. Note: Individual organizations determine their own
pass marks, and the mark can change over time based on the cadre of candidates
recruited.
o Provide candidate admissions letter to candidates that pass.
o Admitted candidate fills bio-data form.
o Input results into candidate management database and screening & assessment metric
tracking dashboard.
o Analyze Data in order to improve processes and for reporting purposes.
58
Screening & Assessment
Lessons Learned/Tips
o An effective self screening method enables candidates go through the screening stage
over two days in order to think through the process and self-reflect.
o Irrespective of how well you screen, some people will drop out at different stages of the
process, hence it is important to recruit (2-3 times) more people than required for
enrollment.
o Screening can be done efficiently without actual in-person interviews. Online
assessments can be used as an effective tool.

Training Delivery
Why It’s Important
At the core of the WAVE model is the training curriculum and how its instructors deliver it to
its trainees. The act of teaching or training involves two primary stakeholders– the trainer
and the trainee. The manner in which knowledge is shared and disseminated is important
as it determines if trainees will be able to meet the expected outcomes.
The WAVE pedagogy is based on an experiential learning approach that aims to make the
learning experience as applicable and relevant as possible to the life and workplace of
trainees. WAVE does not want to prepare its trainees for standardized, theoretical exams,
nor does it believe that there is one single set of factual knowledge that will fundamentally
address youth unemployment.
63
Training Delivery
Experiential learning is the process of learning through
experience, and is more specifically defined as "learning
through reflection on doing. Experiential education first
immerses learners in an experience and then
encourages reflection about the experience to develop
new skills, new attitudes, or new ways of thinking.
Instruction. Detailed information telling how
something should be done, operated.
Review. Formally going over the content and ideas
generated during the training. The objective is to ensure
understanding of key concepts introduced during the
training session
Principles
Tell me, I forget; show me, I remember; involve me, I understand.
This adage is the foundational principle of WAVE’s training, and sets the tone for the entire
program and how WAVE relates with its trainees throughout their association with the
organization. At WAVE, the goal of the training is not to merely have trainees go through
the training program, earn certificates, and report increasing output numbers, but rather to
have trainees go through the program having gained a deeper understanding of new
concepts and skills with the ability to apply them in both their personal and professional
lives.
With this in mind, the WAVE training is heavily reliant on involving trainees in order to
ensure that they are experiencing concepts as opposed to just being taught those concepts.
At WAVE, 10% of the training is instruction, 70% experiential and 20% review time.
64
Training Delivery
WAVE wants its trainees to grow into self-motivated individuals, willing to learn on the job
and equipped with important mental tools and skills to solve problems and communicate
professionally. The curriculum aims to enable trainees experience and remember such
skills through practical application, case studies, teamwork exercises, peer feedback,
individual learning logbooks, repetition and guest speakers such as alumni who succeeded
professionally while embracing the WAVE values and skills.
One way WAVE ensures trainees learn key concepts by experience is by integrating the
experience in non-traditional ways. For example, in order to teach the concept of money
management, time management, budgeting and negotiation skills, rather than only
providing classroom instructions on the topic, we provide groups of trainees a
predetermined amount of money and ask each team to use the funds to provide lunch for
their fellow trainees for the day. Trainees are put into a real world situation and asked to
apply the skill. After the activity, trainees are encouraged to share their thoughts on the
experience and provide feedback. The feedback is done with the larger group and
individually within personal log books. Active involvement and self reflection are part of the
WAVE training culture and is highly encouraged. We believe this is the best way for
trainees to learn and apply skills and more broadly, to learn how to learn, retain knowledge,
and get the most out of the program.
65
Training Delivery
Principle in Action!
Here are steps in designing/implementing experiential activities:
1. Identify which parts of your curriculum will benefit from experiential learning (Ex: Negotiation
Module)
2. Think of problems you want trainees to solve, the objectives and outcomes of the module (How
to use communication, problem solving methods, creativity as tools for negotiations)
3. Think of what activities will help bring out the identified “problem” (Purchasing lunch for the team
with a set budget).
4. Identify relevant and thought provoking questions which trainees can use to reflect on their
experience post activity. Reflection can be done as a group, individually in log books etc.
5. Identify concepts that are relevant to the subject in order to explain experience and ideas
generated from reflection (Game Theory, Stages of Negotiations, BATNA, Non-Verbal
Communication)
6. Implement the above experiential learning cycle in class ensuring trainees participate in step 4 -
active experimentation how to connect new learning in other situations and experiences.
 1. Concrete Experience (Doing/Having
an experience)
2. Reflective Observation
(Reviewing/Reflecting on this
experience)
3. Abstract Conceptualisation
(Concluding/Learning from the
experience, synthesizing new
knowledge and perspectives)
4. Active Experimentation
(Planning/Trying out what you have
learned in future scenarios)
66
Training Delivery
Principle in Action!
Below are different methods to help create a learner centered classroom
o oArrange classroom in a manner that allows for collaboration amongst fellow trainees – avoid setting up seats in
rows, lecture style facing the instructor as this puts the instructor at the center. Have the trainees sit in a
U-shaped seating configuration. This takes away undue attention from the trainer as the expert and sends cues
to learners that learning can be drawn from anyone. Instructor should move around the classroom so they are “a
guide on the side” rather than a “sage on the stage”
o
o Take time to get to know your trainees and their employment journeys.
o Involve trainees in establishing the classroom rules and expectations.
o Ask open ended questions to facilitate discussions – encourage sharing of ideas and opinions.
o Facilitator should respectfully listen to all ideas, even if contrary. Always inquire about “WHY”.
o Ask exit questions at the end of the day to gain immediate feedback and to serve as content
review for the trainees.
o Ensure trainees reflect on the day’s learning in their Trainee Logbook on the day. This
encourages active learning and accountability to the learning process.
Principles
Always focus on the learners (learner centered instruction)
Learner or student centered instruction is a training approach that puts the learner’s
perspective, as opposed to the instructor’s, at the center of the training. Similar to the
curriculum design phase, within a learner centered framework, delivering the training must
take the trainees into consideration and keep their needs at the center by actively engaging
them with content, encouraging inquiry and reflection while facilitating discussions as
opposed to one-directional instructions. This is all done with the aim of getting the trainees
to take ownership of their learning, think critically about the topic at hand and how it
relates to their lives, while providing them with the maximum opportunity to learn.
AT WAVE, when delivering training, we ensure that the trainee is at the center as this
creates a better experience. The instructor is focused on what the trainees need to know in
order to be successful in the workplace. Trainees are asked questions and encouraged to
participate. When questions are asked, they are often open-ended questions in order to
provide an opportunity to go beyond yes or no answers. Trainees are engaged, excited and
doing most of the talking.

Training Delivery
Principles
Repetition is the mother of skills.
To develop any skills and/or to learn a new concept, repetition is required. New learning has
to be repeated and reinforced for it to be truly remembered and understood. This principle is
relatively straightforward and one that is applicable in our lives, outside of formal training
programs. Think back to when you were learning to ride a bicycle, or learning geometry. In
order to fully gain the skills and knowledge, practice in the form of repetition was the norm.
Young children learned to ride their bicycles first within their compounds with no cars, then
slowly graduate to the streets (cars around with adult supervision) and then
perhaps around the neighbourhood on their own. They were provided with different
conditions where they could master the skills of riding their bikes.
At WAVE, the concepts and skills taught do not merely present themselves in the titled
module but rather throughout the program. This is done not only to impress the importance
of the concept but also for the trainees to experience the concept in different situations. The
WAVE curriculum has a dedicated problem-solving module; however, trainees learn the
concept of problem solving in other modules and activities. For example, on the first day
of training ,trainees are given a challenge to solve with teammates. This activity requires
using principles of problem solving. As the program progresses, trainees are required to
provide lunch for their fellow trainees. This activity is not part of any module, and on the
surface does not appear to be part of the formal training; however, concepts learned in the
problem solving module are required to accomplish the task. WAVE has intentionally
ensured that key concepts are repeated and experienced in different ways to help trainees
with the learning process.
69
Training Delivery
Principle in Action!
Tips on how to repeat key concepts in training curriculum
It is the facilitator’s responsibility to guide learning. As a facilitator, always seek out opportunities for
trainees to draw upon previous learning, and actively encourage trainees to apply new learning.
o Review concepts in different formats to ensure multiple levels of exposure.
o Hold review activities at the beginning and end of the day.
o Space out the repetition of concepts/skills in order to improve learning and retention of
information.

70
Training Delivery
Principles
Continuous and real time feedback helps trainees monitor their
progress.
During the training, it is important to provide real time feedback in order to help trainees
gauge their understanding of the concepts and the skills being taught. In addition,
constructive feedback helps trainees improve their performance. However, feedback should
be multi-directional: from trainer to trainee, trainee to trainer, and trainee to fellow trainee.
It is important that all stakeholders are being evaluated not for the purpose of passing a test
but rather to learn and improve. When providing feedback, it should be specific, timely, and
relevant to the subject at hand and delivered in a manner that is focused on improvement
as opposed to criticism. Empowering trainees with the ability to give and receive positive
and negative feedback is an important aspect of training delivery.
Principle in Action!
Feedback can be provided using the sandwich feedback technique (Positive - Constructive
Feedback- Positive). With this technique, the person providing the feedback provides constructive
feedback between two instances of positive performances.
P – Positive. At first, you recognize something positive. This can be, for example, someone’s
presence, the fact that you enjoyed working with them, or that a contribution that you genuinely
appreciated.
C – Constructive feedback. You then suggest something that the person can improve, something
that hasn’t gone well, or another way in which a problem could have been solved, or any other form
of constructive feedback.
P – Positive. You finish feedback with another positive remark.
71
Training Delivery
The WAVE Way
A typical WAVE training is 3-weeks long from 8am – 6pm. A day usually consists of 5 to 7
classes. A class can be just one activity or a set of activities. Apart from the activities, each
class is typically structured as follows:
1. Trainer gives an overview of the lesson plan for the module
2. Content matter expert/trainer facilitates the class starting with an activity and follows
the module’s lesson plan.
3. Towards the end, the trainer makes sure the core knowledge and/or skills are
reiterated in a repetition phase.
4. Learning outcomes from the class are assessed in a diagnosis, reflection and
feedback phase. Repetition, diagnosis and reflection can either be separate
processes or happen at the same time. For example, a group feedback session can
be a way to diagnose and repeat what the trainees have aken away from the class,
while it is also a way to reflect and provide feedback.
5. Trainer administers exit questions.
6. Trainer ensure trainees reflect on the new learning using their logbooks. They are
prompted by questions: “one thing I took away”, “one thing I still don’t understand”
and “one thing I’d like to know/understand more about.” These reflections are
submitted and reviewed to find common themes which guide the trainer in the review
session the following day or at the end of the training week.

o Treat trainees with respect.
o Seek to understand why a participant may be a distraction. Do not dismiss them, rather

o Facilitators should challenge the learners to answer their own questions by redirecting
the questions back to them.
o Facilitators hold multiple roles - counselor, role model, mentor, friend, and disciplinarian.
o Participants come from different backgrounds and these backgrounds can influence their
ability to apply the skills they learn in training. Encourage them to go out of their comfort
zones (family, friends or colleagues) to practice what they have learnt in class.
o Trainees do not all learn at the same pace. Encourage peer to peer learning by pairing
trainees with each other.
o Incorporate role playing or job shadowing as a means of reinforcing the class teaching.
This is often a better measure of how a participant is likely to apply the knowledge
gained outside of class.

This section of the toolkit is targeted towards organizations that are interested in matching
candidates to available vacancies. Organizations that will find this section beneficial are
organizations that are committed to not just placing candidates in any available jobs, but
also focused on ensuring there is afit based on individual competencies and competencies
required by the job. These organizations are focused on making the matching process as
data-driven and objective as possible.
Definition
Job matching is defined as a service provided by a company or agency aimed at finding
suitable jobs for a candidate. This component of the WAVE model involves matching youth
who have successfully been trained with an employer within WAVE’s employer network.
The match process aligns the candidates’ competencies with the requirements of the
employer, ensuring a higher likelihood of a mutually beneficial work relationship between
both parties. The process focuses not just on the candidate seeking a job, but also on the
Employer Partner (EP) seeking to fill a role with suitable candidates.
Outcomes
This section of the toolkit will provide you with the tools and resources that will enable you
to:
o Understand the importance of competency based job matching.
o Implement the different components of job placement services.
o Apply WAVE’s job matching principles to effectively place candidates to jobs.
Job Matching
76
Job Matching
Why It’s Important
The fourth step in the WAVE model is job matching. The job matching process is aimed at
placing alumni to available job vacancies in EPs. This process requires a dedicated team
to find vacancies, manage alumni, EPs, and the relationship between alumni and EPs.
One of the primary goals of a demand-driven training program is to successfully place
candidates into job roles that require the newly acquired skills and competencies that the
alumni possess. A successful match is one where both alumni and EP are happy with the
outcome, thus leading to higher job retention rates. The job placement service and the
organization’s ability to make this final and critical step a reality validates your
organization’s training curriculum, its ability to collaborate with local EPs in order to close
skills gaps, and ability to merge the unique but co-dependent needs of both alumni and
employers.
As a placement organization, your organization has two main clients - alumni and EP. Both
clients are critical for the success of your business and should be treated and managed with
care. Alumni, EP, and your organization need one another in order to realize individual and
organizational goals and achieve success. The alumni needs a job in order to be financially
secure and meet personal/professional goals, EP requires well trained employees to help
meet the organization’s goals, and your organization needs both alumni and EP to value the
services provided in order for both stakeholders to recommend their peers for your services,
enabling you to meet your targets.
Establishing a solid Career Services and Employer Partnership (CSEP) unit is paramount
for success. As a customer-facing role, it is important to staff the unit with individuals that
are relationship builders, have the capacity to manage expectations and situations, and are
strong communicators. Managing employers and providing top notch customer services
ensures that we are supporting their businesses, and their businesses are positioned to
grow, thus creating job opportunities for our alumni.
77
Job Matching
Principles
Match based on competencies and not credentials.
Matching candidates based on competencies, and not credentials, is the fundamental
principle WAVE applies when it places its candidates into job vacancies. “Competencies
specify “how” a person performs a job tasks, while skills focus on “what” the person needs
in order to perform the job successfully. Competencies “include abilities and behaviors, as
well as knowledge that is fundamental to the use of a skill.” Credentials, on the other hand,
refer to a person’s qualifications, such as academic achievements or certifications. Utilizing
a competency based model versus a credential based model in job placement leads to
better matches and optimum on the job performance translating to greater job satisfaction
and higher retention rates: a win-win for all stakeholders.
Competency based matching will be new to EPs who have heavily relied on credentials or
past experiences as the foundation for their hiring practices. As a result, during initial
partnership meetings with EPs, WAVE makes the case for competency based matching in
order to clearly demonstrate the benefits to all stakeholders.
78
Job Matching
Principle in Action!
Below are some supporting points to help make your case for competency based matching.
o The world is changing, companies including tech giants like Google, Apple and IBM do not
require candidates to have a college degree.
Furthermore, competency based recruitment:
o Improves objectivity in the recruiting process.
o Ensures the best fit is hired for the vacancy.
o Reduces turnover rate, thus reducing hiring and retraining costs.
o Provides standards for evaluating the success of the selection process, e.g. correlating the
results of the selection process with competency-based on-the-job performance.
79
Job Matching
Principles
Use objective tools such as competency tests to better match
candidates to job.
Competency based job matching is critical as it leads to better matches and higher retention
rates - a win-win for all stakeholders. However, in order to get such results, it is important to
utilize assessment tools. Employment competency tools are computer or paper-based tools
used to measure candidates’ competencies in a standardized manner. These tools enable
matching organizations to have a better understanding of the competency levels of its
alumni.
There are various competency and assessment tools, which assess different abilities
including behavioral, technical, computer literacy skills, cognitive abilities, grit, etc. As a
result, when making a selection for the best tool to utilize, it is important to ensure the
selected tools measure the competencies and skills which EPs have stated to be of
importance.
It is important to remember that the overall goal is to ensure a successful match where both
alumni and EPs are satisfied with the placement. This can only be achieved by carefully
shortlisting candidates that best match the competency requirements of a given job role.
Many candidates can learn the required skills for a job; however, in addition to those skills,
competencies (things that will make them successful on the job) and the level at which a
candidate is performing, are important in the job matching process.
WAVE utilizes various competency exams and assessment tools to align the candidate as
closely as possible to the job requirements. The tools utilized vary in terms of what they
assess in a candidate. Every WAVE alumnus takes WAVE’s competency exams which
forms their profile. The results are logged against their profile on a computer-based system
and when a vacancy is available only those that match the required competencies are
short-listed.
80
Job Matching
Competency assessments are often licensed exams, which have to be paid for. However
there are many on the market, which are priced at different price points. WAVE currently
uses Core Score and Berke (licensed competency assessments) along with other
assessment tools created in house to test for specific skills such as digital literacy.
Berke is a pre-employment assessment that uses data-driven insights to predict hiring
success. Berke can be used to measure personality traits and problem-solving skills and
compare candidates to job benchmarks customized to your company.
Core Score® is an innovative portfolio of competency-based soft skills assessments for
entry and mid-skill workers and jobs. Core Score® may be used to measure an individual's
skills, as well identify those likely to be good and top performers on the job.
Principle in Action!
How to identify relevant assessments:
• Identify and define the core competencies your organization is interested in assessing for
(Note, it should mirror that required from the labour market).
• Conduct desk research to find out what competency assessment tools are available on the
market and which ones you can create in house.
• Speak to HR industry professionals to gain insights on what tools are best suited for your
organizations' needs.
• If budget is a concern, partner with organizations' that have access to licensed assessments at
negotiated best rates.
• Select competency tools that are user friendly and provide explanatory reports which test takes
can go through in order to understand their profile.

81
Job Matching
Principles
A successful match is one where both alumni and employers are
happy, and retention rates are high.
WAVE defines a successful match as one where both alumni and employers are satisfied
with the placement and retention rates are high. A satisfied alumnus is excited to go into his
or her place of employment, and looks forward to building a long career in the organization.
A happy EP is satisfied with the value the alumnus is creating and has no need to lay him or
her off unless as a result of operating problems. Happy and satisfied clients are an indicator
that the entire program from the curriculum design to the placement phases is meeting its
objectives and outcomes.
WAVE ensures that it gathers data on both employer and alumni satisfaction and job
retention rates by utilizing satisfaction surveys. This data is used to adjust and improve the
process. In addition, WAVE ensures customers are happy by providing EPs with additional
services such as quarterly training for alumni,, custom trainings and workshops.
Both alumni and EPs are satisfied if their expectations are met and if they feel like their
needs are being met. By analyzing data collected over the years, WAVE has identified 6
key indicators that are predictive of whether an alumni will accept a job offer, stay on the job
and perform. If there is a strong alignment between these indicators and the job description,
a successful match can be realized.
Indicators:
1) Salary Alignment
2) Percentage of income spent on commuting
3) Competency ranking
4) Job role preference
5) Motivator rankings
6) Average commuting time
82
Job Matching
Principle in Action!
Retention rates are high when expectations are met and aligned. Issues reported by both EP and
alumni are taken seriously and investigated in order to ensure issues are resolved. Below are
examples of common issues and how WAVE addresses them.
Alumni Reported issues:
• Instances of abuse – verbal, physical and/or sexual are investigated. EPs that are found guilty of
any of these types of abuses will have their contracts terminated with WAVE and all alumni
removed from the business.
• Salary reduction/non-payment – EPs that do not pay alumni salary for 2 months or more are
terminated.
• Working hours – EPs contracts are terminated if alumni work more than 12 hours a day/6 days a
week
EP Reported issues:
• General performance complaints – All general complaints reported by EP must follow the steps
outlined in the How to Resolve Reported EP Issue guideline. If the issue can not be resolved,
invoke the Customer Service and Guarantee program clause.
• Theft – If there is evidence of theft, alumnus must refund the employer with cash. If the alumnus
cannot afford to refund the employer, the alumnus’ guarantor is bound by the tripartite
agreement to compensate the employer, and an additional agreement needs to be signed by all
parties to this effect.
83

Principles
Relationship management is key and keeps you in business.
Managing alumni and EP relationships is critical to staying in business. Your organization’s
success relies on the success of your alumni and their performance within the businesses
in which they are placed in. Equally important is the EP, which provides the job
opportunities for your alumni. Thus, it is important to not only establish good relationships,
but also to continuously manage those relationships with the aim of ensuring all
stakeholders are satisfied with the process and have a positive experience. Open and
constant communication, as well as managing expectations, are important in relationship
management. Happy customers lead to referrals and repeat service.
WAVE incorporates the principle of relationship management in every aspect of its process.
At the recruitment phase, the organization seeks to ensure all candidates have a positive
experience regardless of if they gain admissions into the program as they will return to the
community and be unofficial spokespeople. A positive experience can be created by simply
being courteous, answering all questions, following up with candidates, and thoroughly
explaining the program during the information sessions. When an alumnus is selected for
interview, he or she is provided with detailed information about the job before hand, given
tips about how to perform, gets a toolkit which serves as a brief reminder on the do’s and
don’ts, as well as a phone call the day of interview from a WAVE staff. Managing and
showing that we care about their success helps them perform at their best.
Before officially engaging an EP, WAVE holds a thorough meeting in order to understand
the EP’s human resource needs as well as organizational growth plans. In addition, EPs are
educated on WAVE’s terms and conditions for engagement to ensure they fully understand
their obligations to WAVE and alumni, and WAVE’s obligation to them. A WAVE team
constantly provides additional services and support throughout the course of WAVE’s
relationship with an EP.

Follow these tips in order to build and manage relationships with your EPs:
o Ensure your EP’s satisfaction is your number one priority. Clearly outline a customer promise
and guarantee program to ensure EPs are getting value from your service.
o Routinely invite EPs to events your organization is hosting (e.g. graduations, annual gatherings).
This will keep them in the loop of activities, while providing them with an opportunity to observe
your organization’s growth and impact.
o Include EPs in your mailing list and send quarterly (or annual) reports about your organization
and its impact.
o Send end of the year thank you letter and/or corporate gift (if available).
o Publicly recognize EPs for their contribution to your organization’s success.
o Periodically check in on EPs who have employed youth from your training program. This can be
done via a phone conversation or by administering an employer satisfaction survey.
Follow these tips in order to build and manage relationships with your alumni:
o Manage expectations of alumni – do not promise what you can not deliver.
o Create easy to use toolkits to help alumni prepare for upcoming interviews.
o Communicate once a month with alumni to monitor their on the job progress.
o Find ways to involve alumni in order to make them feel as a part of a community – create case
studies on their post training experience, invite alumni as guest speakers, acknowledge their
successes publicly.

Principles
Monitor alumni/employee satisfaction to improve matching.
It is important to understand if your customers are happy with your services. However it is
not enough to only monitor the current state of your alumni and employees; the ultimate
goal is to use the information gathered from the collected data to improve your overall
matching process.
Satisfaction surveys do not only provide information on current customer satisfaction but
over time can become a predictive tool on gathering information on what actually makes a
customer satisfied. Over the years, WAVE has analyzed its data with the aim of narrowing
down predictors of success from the alumni’s perspective. These predictors, including
motivation, location, salary, competency, alignments and ability to learn on the job, have
helped with better matching, further improving the process and creating efficiencies.
Principle in Action!
Tips on monitoring EP satisfaction:
o Monitor employer by administering an employer satisfaction survey.
o If alumni has been fired, provide an employer dissatisfaction survey to gain insights on what
went wrong.
o If EP reports issues with alumni, aim to contact EP within 24 hours of hearing the issue and
resolve all issues reported within 5 business days.
o Keep track of issues and share with curriculum design team in order to train future trainees on
recurring issues.
o Analyze data to understand what key factors make an EP satisfied with your service.
Tips on monitoring alumni satisfaction
o Monitor alumni satisfaction by administering an alumni retention survey.
o Have genuine conversations with alumni about their jobs and progress.
o Analyze data to understand what key factors make an alumni satisfied with your service.
o Use those key factors to improve matching.

Job Matching
Principles
Agreements are necessary to protect all stakeholders.
It is important to have a document that clearly spells out what is expected from each party.
This document serves as the point of reference if situations arise.
WAVE utilizes a tripartite agreement, which is signed between WAVE, the selected
candidate, and EP. The agreement is a legally binding contract which documents all the
terms of the job including salary, working hours and conditions, expectations from all
stakeholders to one another, and guaranty terms.
Principle in Action!
Sample Agreements
Use WAVE’s Tripartite Agreement and adapt to your organization’s need.

Principles
Gather data in order to validate competency tools to ensure
accuracy.
Once an investment has been made in a competency tool, it is important to validate the
data the tool produces to ensure that the tool is being predictive and helping the
organization shortlist the best candidates for a particular job role. It is important to keep in
the forefront that competency tools are to help make the matching process more objective,
scientific and efficient. Validating competency scores ensures there’s a strong correlation
between alumni scores and scores provided by employers.
WAVE validates competency results by administering surveys to its EPs. Using the PRS
survey (qualitative survey created by Core Score) the team is able to gather data on if a
certain competency tool accurately predicted that a candidate would perform well in a given
role, which highlighted certain competencies as key. It is important to note that the word
“predicted” within this context means the ability to identify a particular competency in a
candidate. In addition, with further analysis, the organization uses the data to narrow down
what key competencies its high performers and low performers have in common. The data
from that exercise is used to further improve the entire program from the curriculum to
matching.
88
Job Matching
Principle in Action!
There are several ways to validate competency results. Below is a method WAVE uses to
understand if the competency tool, Core Score, is predictive of how an alumni will perform on the
job. The process is continuously being improved upon.
Core Score provides a quantitative result, while the PRS survey is qualitative.
1. Administer competency assessment and record the score in alumni management database.
2. Once alumni is placed in a job, administer PRS survey to EP to get a qualitative assessment of
alumni’s performance.
3. Compare score to PRS survey results
oIf alumni received a high score on the Core Score competency assessment, it is expected that
reported performance will be excellent, above average., the opposite is expected.
4. Keep track of data and analyze to examine trends.

The WAVE Way
Competency Based Job-Matching
Matching alumni to jobs based on competency ensures that the matching process is
objective and the best set of people for a specific job role is shortlisted, thus creating a
higher likelihood of a successful match. As a demand-driven program, the aim is to ensure
that alumni are up skilled (trained) with competencies and skills that are relevant and
desired by EPs. The training program should therefore focus on the desired skills and
competencies.
 Selecting a Competency Assessment
o Confirm with EP the key competencies it requires and the desired skill level.
o Conduct research on the various assessment tools on the market (Note: there are
some free tools which can be used, while others require a significant financial
investment).
o Decide which tools can be created in-house in order to reduce cost (Note: Microsoft
Excel and Word tests can be created in-house)
o Select relevant assessment test.
o Confirm that assessment tests are appropriate by ensuring your audience can easily
use it.
Validating Competency Assessment
o Administer the competency test to alumni.
o Record candidates’ scores in database (Excel, Sales force).
o Once candidates are placed in jobs, conduct Alumni Satisfaction Survey and
Employer Satisfaction Survey.
o Analyze survey results by looking for commonalities across all candidates.

Career Services
Career Services is the unit in an organization that provides information, advice and
guidance on learning, training, career choice, career development, job search, and the
labour market. The objective of the unit is to work with the alumni in getting prepared for an
interview and eventually placing the alumni in a paid job within weeks of graduating.
The career services unit offers three types of services: pre-match, matching and
post-match.
Pre- Match
o CV preparation. In order to get an alumni prepared for a potential job interview, it is
important that they have a strong resume which reflects their skills and job experience.
o Elevator Pitch. An elevator pitch is a quick overview of a candidate’s background and
experience. At WAVE, it is in a 30-second video format which alumni record during the
training session and is presented to EPs in order for them to select candidates they
want to interview. EPs can assess particular traits such as appearance, diction, non
-verbal communication, and confidence.
o Mock Interview. All alumni must go through a mock interview to help them better
acquaint themselves with an interview environment and potential questions. Mock
interviews better prepare the candidates as they get feedback on their performances
and know areas of strength and weaknesses to improve upon.
91
Job Matching
o Administer Competency Exams. Administering competency exams to all candidates
will enable your organization to match candidates to jobs in a more objective and
data-driven manner. Assessments reveal more about your candidate’s true potential,
personality, and work style. In addition, assessments enable the candidate to
understand their strengths and weaknesses and identify what type of jobs is best suited
for them.
o Hold Career Services Day. Implementers are advised to hold a Career Services Day, a
day in which alumni gather together to understand what will be expected from them once
they are placed, and additional resources on how to secure jobs for themselves. At this
forum it is important to review an employment guideline, contracts, and competencies
required for different job vacancy categories.
Match
o Announce Vacancy to Alumni. Once there is a vacancy, announce it to your alumni to
gauge interest.
o Shortlist 3- 4 candidates for EP selection. Use Alumni Management database to
identify and shortlist alumni with the required competencies for the available vacancy.
Send CVs and elevator pitches to EP.
o Retrieve shortlisted candidates and feedback from EP. EP selects candidates they
want to interview. Ask for feedback for all shortlisted candidates. Enter feedback into
Alumni Management Database.
92
Job Matching
o Inform selected candidates of interview. Send interview details via email and text
messages to candidates. Specify that candidate should confirm receipt of message, and
should also call once they are done with the interview.
Call alumni to confirm dress code, transportation route, and share information about
employer (name, type of business, location, role and duties). In addition, check in
on alumni 2 hours before interview to confirm they are en route.
o Provide candidates with pre-interview toolkit. A pre-interview toolkit is a simple guide
that highlights the necessary do’s and don’ts of an interview. A cheat sheet of sorts
should be distributed to candidates to help them prepare for their upcoming interview.
o Interview feedback. After the interview, have a phone debrief session with the
candidate to get their assessment of the interview.
o Share EPs Feedback. Pass on feedback, whether positive or negative, from the
employer to the alumnus.
o Match. If alumnus is selected, notify the candidate and sign the Tripartite Agreement
between WAVE, alumnus and recruiting organization. The agreement outlines the terms
and conditions that are in align with WAVE’s values and compensation structure and are
designed to ensure that both recruiting organization and alumni fulfill their financial
obligations to WAVE. WAVE ensures that it provides excellent customer service to the
recruiting organization as well as continuous support for alumni, while alumni are
ensured they are working under acceptable working conditions and being paid the
agreed upon salary.
Post- Match
o Check-ins. Periodically check in with both alumni and employer to ensure the
relationship is going well.

Employer Partnerships
Building partnerships with employers is a process of identifying and establishing meaningful
relationships with hiring organizations in order to reach mutually beneficial goals. It is
important to note that employer partnerships is an ongoing process, and is foundational to
your program. Ideally, your organization should already have formed solid partnerships with
employers at the curriculum development stage when EPs provide data on the types of
skills and competencies that are relevant for their industries.
The objective of engaging potential EPs is to develop new partners with the aim of listing a
vacancy while maintaining relationships with current employers of your alumni.
Steps in building new/maintaining old relationships
o Network frequently in order to gain insights on organizations that are hiring or those that
require the services your organization provides.
o Ask current EPs to refer your services to other organizations.
o Identify/outline your organization’s value proposition. Develop a presentation about your
organization and what it can offer to different partners. The presentation should include
relevant information about your organization, such as its mission, vision, services and
value proposition. Ensure the value proposition is aligned with the EPs goals.
o Be responsive with EPs, always follow up with partners on agreed next steps. Following
up ensures that you are continuously engaged with your partners and are constantly
keeping your end of the bargain. Follow up in a systematic manner.
o Maintain relationships with EPs by checking in to ensure alumnus is performing well and
that their business is thriving.
o Administer employer satisfaction survey to gauge EP’s satisfaction with your services
and alumni.

competencies that matter most.
o Build partnerships with organizations that share the same goals as your organization.
o Remain open-minded. Focus on what is working. Always focus your mind on the idea of
"scaling up” and have accurate data!

99
Alumni Support Job Matching
Principles
Alumni are the unofficial public face of your organization and their
success is your organization’s success.
An employed alumni is the face of your organization; thus, it is important from a brand
management perspective to ensure that their behavior and performance is consistently in
line with your expectations as an organization. It is also important to make sure that
program alumni are not only placed in jobs, but that they are successful within the jobs.
Periodic check-ins via phone calls enable you to get a better understanding of their job
performance.
WAVE conducts its check-ins through alumni development workshops. Holding a quarterly
workshop is a way to gather all your alumni together and hold a debrief session where they
can provide feedback on how their employment is going, seek additional guidance on how
to deal with difficult situations, and for the organization to re-share its employment
guidelines and policies. At these workshops, you can hold mini refreshers on technical skills
learned during training, as well as advertise new vacancies. WAVE also conducts Master
classes, which provide refresher courses on soft skills topics covered during the training. In
addition, surveys are conducted to alumni to get a sense of how they are faring on the job.
